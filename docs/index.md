# AOK (Awk's Object Knotation)

AOK is a pre-processor to AWK code that adds:

- Abstract data types;
- Easy methods to list the  attributes and operations of that data;
- Object constructors;
- Nested object constructors.

## Install, configure, test

To install AOK on LINUX or Mac:

1. Download the files  `aok` and `aok.rc` from `http://github.com/ttv1/aok`. 
2. Change the mode of the file using `chmod +x aok`.

To configure, edit the file `aok.rc`. Here's my current file:

```
MyName="'Tim Menzies'"
MyEmail=""'tim@menzies.us'"
```
